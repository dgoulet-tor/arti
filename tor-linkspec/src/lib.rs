//! `tor-linkspec`: Descriptions of Tor relays, as used to connect to them.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The `tor-linkspec` crate provides traits and data structures that
//! describe how to connect to Tor relays.
//!
//! When describing the location of a Tor relay on the network, the
//! Tor protocol uses a set of "link specifiers", each of which
//! corresponds to a single aspect of the relay's location or
//! identity—such as its IP address and port, its Ed25519 identity
//! key, its (legacy) RSA identity fingerprint, or so on.  This
//! crate's [`LinkSpec`] type encodes these structures.
//!
//! When a client is building a circuit through the Tor network, it
//! needs to know certain information about the relays in that
//! circuit.  This crate's [`ChanTarget`] and [`CircTarget`] traits
//! represent objects that describe a relay on the network that a
//! client can use as the first hop, or as any hop, in a circuit.
//!
//! This crate is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.  Several
//! other crates in Arti depend on it.  You will probably not need
//! this crate yourself unless you are interacting with the Tor
//! protocol at a fairly low level.
//!
//! `tor-linkspec` is a separate crate so that it can be used by other
//! crates that expose link specifiers and by crates that consume
//! them.
//!
//! ## Future work
//!
//! TODO: Possibly we should rename this crate.  "Linkspec" is a
//! pretty esoteric term in the Tor protocols.
//!
//! TODO: Possibly the link specifiers and the `*Target` traits belong in different crates.
