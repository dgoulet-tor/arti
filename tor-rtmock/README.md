# tor-rtmock

Support for mocking with `tor-rtcompat` asynchronous runtimes.

## Overview

The `tor-rtcompat` crate defines a `Runtime` trait that represents
most of the common functionality of .  This crate provides mock
implementations that override a `Runtime`, in whole or in part,
for testing purposes.

This crate is part of
[Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
It is used to write tests for higher-level
crates in Arti that rely on asynchronous runtimes.

This crate should should only be used for writing tests.

Currently, we support mocking the passage of time (via
[`MockSleepRuntime`]), and impersonating the internet (via
[`MockNetRuntime`]).

## Examples

Suppose you've written a function that relies on making a
connection to the network and possibly timing out:

```rust
use tor_rtcompat::{Runtime,SleepProviderExt};
use std::{net::SocketAddr, io::Result, time::Duration, io::Error};
use futures::io::AsyncWriteExt;

async fn say_hi(runtime: impl Runtime, addr: &SocketAddr) -> Result<()> {
   let delay = Duration::new(5,0);
   runtime.timeout(delay, async {
      let mut conn = runtime.connect(addr).await?;
      conn.write_all(b"Hello world!\r\n").await?;
      conn.close().await?;
      Ok::<_,Error>(())
   }).await??;
   Ok(())
}
```

But how should you test this function?

You might try connecting to a well-known website to test the
connection case, and to a well-known black hole to test the
timeout case... but that's a bit undesirable.  Your tests might be
running in a container with no internet access; and even if they
aren't, it isn't so great for your tests to rely on the actual
state of the internet.  Similarly, if you make your timeout too long,
your tests might block for a long time; but if your timeout is too short,
the tests might fail on a slow machine or on a slow network.

Or, you could solve both of these problems by using `tor-rtmock`
to replace the internet _and_ the passage of time.  (Here we're only
replacing the internet.)

```rust
#
use tor_rtmock::{MockSleepRuntime,MockNetRuntime,net::MockNetwork};
use tor_rtcompat::{TcpProvider,TcpListener};
use futures::io::AsyncReadExt;

tor_rtcompat::test_with_all_runtimes!(|rt| async move {

   let addr1 = "198.51.100.7".parse().unwrap();
   let addr2 = "198.51.100.99".parse().unwrap();
   let sockaddr = "198.51.100.99:101".parse().unwrap();

   // Make a runtime that pretends that we are at the first address...
   let fake_internet = MockNetwork::new();
   let rt1 = fake_internet.builder().add_address(addr1).runtime(rt.clone());
   // ...and one that pretends we're listening at the second address.
   let rt2 = fake_internet.builder().add_address(addr2).runtime(rt);
   let listener = rt2.listen(&sockaddr).await.unwrap();

   // Now we can test our function!
   let (result1,output) = futures::join!(
          say_hi(rt1, &sockaddr),
          async {
              let (mut conn,addr) = listener.accept().await.unwrap();
              assert_eq!(addr.ip(), addr1);
              let mut output = Vec::new();
              conn.read_to_end(&mut output).await.unwrap();
              output
          });

   assert!(result1.is_ok());
   assert_eq!(&output[..], b"Hello world!\r\n");
});
```

(TODO: Add an example for the timeout case.)
