//! Parse and represent directory objects used in Tor.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Tor has several "directory objects" that it uses to convey
//! information about relays on the network. They are documented in
//! dir-spec.txt.
//!
//! This crate has common code to parse and validate these documents.
//! Currently, it can handle the metaformat, along with certain parts
//! of the router descriptor type. We will eventually need to handle
//! more types.
//!
//! This crate is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//!
//! ## Design notes
//!
//! The crate is derived into three main parts.  In the [`parse`]
//! module, we have the generic code that we use to parse different
//! kinds of network documents.  In the [`types`] module we have
//! implementations for parsing specific data structures that are used
//! inside directory documents.  Finally, the [`doc`] module defines
//! the parsers for the documents themselves.
//!
//! # Caveat haxxor: limitations and infelicities
//!
//! TODO: This crate requires that all of its inputs be valid UTF-8:
//! This is fine only if we assume that proposal 285 is implemented in
//! mainline Tor.
//!
//! TODO: This crate has several pieces that could probably be split out
//! into other smaller cases, including handling for version numbers
//! and exit policies.
//!
//! TODO: Many parts of this crate that should eventually be public
//! aren't.
//!
//! TODO: this crate needs far more tests!
