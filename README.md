# Arti: reimplementing Tor in Rust

Arti is a project to produce an embeddable, production-quality implementation
of the [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) anonymity protocols in the
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

Arti is **not ready for production use**; [see below](#status) for more information.

## Why rewrite Tor in Rust?

Rust is *more secure than C*.  Despite our efforts, it's all too simple to
mess up when using a language that does not enforce memory safety.  We
estimate that at least half of our tracked security vulnerabilities would
have been impossible in Rust, and many of the others would have been very
unlikely.

Rust enables *faster development than C*. Because of Rust's expressiveness
and strong guarantees, we've found that we can be far more efficient and
confident writing code in Rust.  We hope that in the long run this will
improve the pace of our software development.

Arti is *more flexible than our C tor implementation*.  Unlike our C `tor`,
which was designed as SOCKS proxy originally, and whose integration features
were later "bolted on", Arti is designed from the ground up to work as a
modular, embeddable library that other applications can use.

Arti is *cleaner than our C tor implementation*.  Although we've tried to
develop C tor well, we've learned a lot since we started it back in 2002.
There are lots of places in the current C codebase where complicated
"spaghetti" relationships between different pieces of code make our software
needlessly hard to understand and improve.


## <a name="status"></a>Current status

Arti is a work-in-progress.  It can connect to the Tor network, bootstrap a
view of the Tor directory, and make anonymized connections over the network.

Arti is currently missing some features that are required for good privacy,
and is therefore vulnerable to a lot of attacks that do not yet affect the
Tor network.  Therefore, **you should probably not use Arti in production**
if you want any kind of privacy at all.

There are absolutely no guarantees about API stability yet: if you write code
that uses Arti, you should expect that

## Trying it out today

Arti can act as a SOCKS proxy that uses the Tor network.  (Not a very
secure or anonymous one!)  It knows how to download directory
information and how to load it from cache, but it doesn't try to
download more than one directory per run.

To try it out, run the demo program in `arti` as follows.  It will open a
SOCKS proxy on port 9150.

    % cargo run --release

Again, do not use this program yet if you need anonymity, privacy, security,
or stability.

## Minimum supported Rust Version

Arti should always build with the most recent _stable_ Rust release, and
_may_ build with one or two older Rust releases.  Eventually, we may
declare some long-term Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV), but while
Arti is still in its early stages, you'll need to stay up-to-date.

As of this writing (24 August 2021), Arti works with Rust 1.53 and later.

## Roadmap

Thanks to a generous grant from
[Zcash Open Major Grants (ZOMG)](https://zcashomg.org/), we're able to devote
some significant time to Arti in the years 2021-2022.  Here is our _rough_
set of plans for what we hope to deliver when.

The goal times below are complete imagination, based on broad assumptions about
developer availability.  Please don't take them too seriously until we can
get our project manager to sign off on them.
