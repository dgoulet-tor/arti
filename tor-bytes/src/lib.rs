//! `tor-bytes`: Utilities to decode/encode things into bytes.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The `tor-bytes` crate is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//! Other crates in Arti use it to build and handle all the byte-encoded
//! objects from the Tor protocol.  For textual directory items, see
//! the [`tor-netdoc`] crate.
//!
//! This crate is generally useful for encoding and decoding
//! byte-oriented formats that are not regular enough to qualify for
//! serde, and not complex enough to need a full meta-language.  It is
//! probably not suitable for handling anything bigger than a few
//! kilobytes in size.
//!
//! ## Alternatives
//!
//! The Reader/Writer traits in std::io are more appropriate for
//! operations that can fail because of some IO problem.  This crate
//! can't handle that: it is for handling things that are already in
//! memory.
//!
//! TODO: Look into using the "bytes" crate more here.
//!
//! TODO: The "untrusted" crate has similar goals to our [`Reader`],
//! but takes more steps to make sure it can never panic. Perhaps we
//! should see if we can learn any tricks from it.
//!
//! TODO: Do we really want to keep `Reader` as a struct and
//! `Writer` as a trait?
//!
//! # Contents and concepts
//!
//! This crate is structured around four key types:
//!
//! * [`Reader`]: A view of a byte slice, from which data can be decoded.
//! * [`Writer`]: Trait to represent a growable buffer of bytes.
//!   (Vec<u8> and [`bytes::BytesMut`] implement this.)
//! * [`Writeable`]: Trait for an object that can be encoded onto a [`Writer`]
//! * [`Readable`]: Trait for an object that can be decoded from a [`Reader`].
//!
//! Every object you want to encode or decode should implement
//! [`Writeable`] or [`Readable`] respectively.
//!
//! Once you implement these traits, you can use Reader and Writer to
//! handle your type, and other types that are built around it.
