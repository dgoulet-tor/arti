//! Traits for wrapping up signed and/or time-bound objects
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Frequently (for testing reasons or otherwise), we want to ensure
//! that an object can only be used if a signature is valid, or if
//! some timestamp is recent enough.
//!
//! As an example, consider a self-signed cretificate. You can parse
//! it cheaply enough (and find its key by doing so), but you probably
//! want to make sure that nobody will use that certificate unless its
//! signature is correct and its timestamps are not expired.
//!
//! With the tor-checkable crate, you can instead return an object
//! that represents the certificate in its unchecked state.  The
//! caller can access the certificate, but only after checking the
//! signature and the time.
//!
//! This crate is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//! Many other crates in Arti depend on it, but it should be generally
//! useful outside of Arti.
//!
//! ## Design notes and alternatives
//!
//! The types in this crate provide functions to return the underlying
//! objects without checking them.  This is very convenient for testing,
//! though you wouldn't want to do it in production code.  To prevent
//! mistakes, these functions all begin with the word `dangerously`.
//!
//! Another approach you might take is to put signature and timeliness
//! checks inside your parsing function.  But if you do that, it will
//! get hard to test your code: you will only be able to parse
//! certificates that are valid when the parser is running.  And if
//! you want to test parsing a new kind of certificate, you'll need to
//! make sure to put a valid signature on it.  (And all of this
//! signature parsing will slow down any attempts to fuzz your
//! parser.)
//!
//! You could have your parser take a flag to tell it whether to check
//! signatures and timeliness, but that could be error prone: if anybody
//! sets the flag wrong, they will skip doing the checks.
