//! Implementations for the core Tor protocol
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! The `tor-proto` crate lies at the core of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//! Most people shouldn't use this crate directly,
//! since its APIs are needlessly low-level for most purposes, and it is
//! easy to miuse them in an incsecure or privacy-violating way.
//!
//! Most people should use the [`tor-client`] crate instead.  This crate is
//! of interest mainly for those that want to access the Tor protocols at
//! a low level.
//!
//! ## Core concepts
//!
//! At its essence, Tor makes connections called "channels" to other
//! Tor instances.  These channels are implemented using TLS.  Each of
//! these channels multiplexes a number of anonymized multihop
//! "circuits" that act as reliable transports for "relay messages"
//! that are sent between clients and the different relays on the
//! circuits.  Finally, each circuit multiplexes a number of "streams",
//! each corresponding roughly to an application-level request.
//!
//! This crate implements the logic, protocols, and cryptography that
//! implement these [channel::Channel]s, [circuit::ClientCirc]s, and
//! [stream::DataStream]s.  It uses rust async code and future-related
//! traits, and is intended to work with (nearly) any executor
//! implementation that complies with the futures API.  It should also
//! work with nearly any TLS implementation that exposes AsyncRead and
//! AsyncWrite traits.
//!
//! ## Not in this crate
//!
//! This crate does _not_ implement higher level protocols, like onion
//! services or the Tor directory protocol, that are based on the Tor
//! protocol here.  Nor does it decide _when_, _how_, or _where_ to
//! build channels and circuits: that's the role of higher-level crates.
//!
//! This crate also has no support for timeouts, so every network
//! operation here has the potential to block the current task
//! indefinitely.  Timeouts are another necessary piece that gets
//! added at a higher level.
//!
//! In order to create channels and circuits, you'll need to know
//! about some Tor relays, and expose their information via
//! [tor_linkspec::ChanTarget] and [tor_linkspec::CircTarget].
//! Currently, the [tor-netdir] crate is the easiest way to do so.
//!
//! For an example of this crate in action, see the `tor-client`
//! library, or the `arti` CLI.
//!
//! # Design notes
//!
//! This crate's APIs are structured to explicitly avoid any usage of
//! an asynchronous runtime: It doesn't launch tasks or include
//! timeouts.  Those are done at a higher level in Arti, via the
//! [`tor-rtcompat`] crate.
//!
//! To the extent possible, this crate avoids doing public-key
//! cryptography in the same functions it uses for network activity.
//! This makes it easier for higher-level code to parallelize or yield
//! around public-key operations.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! This is all a work in progress, and will need severe refactoring
//! before it's done.
//!
//! This is a client-only implementation; there is no support the
//! operations that Relays need.
//!
//! There are too many missing features to list.
//!
//! There isn't enough documentation or examples.
//!
//! This crate was my first attempt to use async in rust, and is probably
//! pretty kludgy.
//!
//! I bet that there are deadlocks somewhere in this code.  I fixed
//! all the ones I could find or think of, but it would be great to
//! find a good way to eliminate every lock that we have.
//!
//! This crate doesn't work with rusttls because of a limitation in the
//! webpki crate.
