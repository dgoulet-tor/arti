//! Multi-hop paths over the Tor network.
//!
//! Right now, we only implement "client circuits" -- also sometimes
//! called "origin circuits".  A client circuit is one that is
//! constructed by this Tor instance, and used in its own behalf to
//! send data over the Tor network.
//!
//! Each circuit has multiple hops over the Tor network: each hop
//! knows only the hop before and the hop after.  The client shares a
//! separate set of keys with each hop.
//!
//! To build a circuit, first create a [crate::channel::Channel], then
//! call its [crate::channel::Channel::new_circ] method.  This yields
//! a [PendingClientCirc] object that won't become live until you call
//! one of the methods that extends it to its first hop.  After you've
//! done that, you can call [ClientCirc::extend_ntor] on the circuit to
//! build it into a multi-hop circuit.  Finally, you can use
//! [ClientCirc::begin_stream] to get a Stream object that can be used
//! for anonymized data.
//!
//! # Implementation
//!
//! Each open circuit has a corresponding Reactor object that runs in
//! an asynchronous task, and manages incoming cells from the
//! circuit's upstream channel.  These cells are either RELAY cells or
//! DESTROY cells.  DESTROY cells are handled immediately.
//! RELAY cells are either for a particular stream, in which case they
//! get forwarded to a RawCellStream object, or for no particular stream,
//! in which case they are considered "meta" cells (like EXTENEDED2)
//! that should only get accepted if something is waiting for them.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! This is client-only.
//!
//! There's one big mutex on the whole circuit: the reactor needs to hold
//! it to process a cell, and streams need to hold it to send.
//!
//! There is no flow-control or rate-limiting or fairness.
