//! Coding and decoding for the cell types that make up Tor's protocol
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Tor's primary network protocol is oriented around a set of
//! messages called "Cells".  They exist at two primary layers of the
//! protocol: the channel-cell layer, and the relay-cell layer.
//!
//! [Channel cells](chancell::ChanCell) are sent between relays, or
//! between a client and a relay, over a TLS connection.  Each of them
//! encodes a single [Channel Message](chancell::msg::ChanMsg).
//! Channel messages can affect the channel itself (such as those used
//! to negotiate and authenticate the channel), but more frequently are
//! used with respect to a given multi-hop circuit.
//!
//! Channel message that refer to a circuit do so with a channel-local
//! identifier called a [Circuit ID](chancell::CircId).  These
//! messages include CREATE2 (used to extend a circuit to a first hop)
//! and DESTROY (used to tear down a circuit).  But the most
//! frequently used channel message is RELAY, which is used to send a
//! message to a given hop along a circuit.
//!
//! Each RELAY cell is encrypted and decrypted (according to protocols
//! not implemented in this crate) until it reaches its target.  When
//! it does, it is decoded into a single [Relay
//! Message](relaycell::msg::RelayMsg).  Some of these relay messages
//! are used to manipulate circuits (e.g., by extending the circuit to
//! a new hop); others are used to manipulate anonymous data-streams
//! (by creating them, ending them, or sending data); and still others
//! are used for protocol-specific purposes (like negotiating with an
//! onion service.)
//!
//! For a list of _most_ of the cell types used in Tor, see
//! [tor-spec.txt](https://spec.torproject.org/tor-spec).  Other cell
//! types are defined in [rend-spec-v3.txt (for onion
//! services)](https://spec.torproject.org/tor-spec) and
//! [padding-spec.txt (for padding
//! negotiation)](https://spec.torproject.org/padding-spec).
//!
//! This crate is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//!
//! # Futureproofing note:
//!
//! There are two pending proposals to remove the one-to-one
//! correspondence between relay cells and relay messages.
//!
//! [Proposal 319](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/master/proposals/319-wide-everything.md)
//! would add a "RELAY_FRAGMENT" command that would allow larger relay
//! messages to span multiple RELAY cells.
//!
//! [Proposal 325](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/torspec/-/blob/master/proposals/325-packed-relay-cells.md),
//! on the other hand, would allow multiple relay messages to be
//! packed into a single RELAY cell.
//!
//! The distinction betweeen RelayCell and RelayMsg is meant in part
//! to future-proof arti against these proposals if they are adopted.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! There aren't any tests.
//!
//! There isn't enough documentation.
//!
//! This is the first part of the project I started working on, and
//! probably reflects the most naive understranding of Rust.
