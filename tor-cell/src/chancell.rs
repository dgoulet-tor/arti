//! Messages sent over Tor channels
//!
//! A 'channel' is a direct connection between a tor client and a
//! relay, or between two relays.  Current channels all use TLS.
//!
//! This module implements the [ChanCell] type, which is the encoding for
//! data sent over a channel.  It also encodes and decodes various
//! channel messages, which are the types of data conveyed over a
//! channel.
