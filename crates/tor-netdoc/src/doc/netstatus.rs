//! Parsing implementation for networkstatus documents.
//!
//! In Tor, a networkstatus documents describes a complete view of the
//! relays in the network: how many there are, how to contact them,
//! and so forth.
//!
//! A networkstatus document can either be a "votes" -- an authority's
//! view of the network, used as input to the voting process -- or a
//! "consensus" -- a combined view of the network based on multiple
//! authorities' votes, and signed by multiple authorities.
//!
//! A consensus document can itself come in two different flavors: a
//! "ns"-flavored consensus has references to router descriptors, and
//! a "microdesc"-flavored consensus has references to
//! microdescriptors.
//!
//! To keep an up-to-date view of the network, clients download
//! microdescriptor-flavored consensuses periodically, and then
//! download whatever microdescriptors the consensus lists that the
//! client doesn't already have.
//!
//! For full information about the network status format, see
//! [dir-spec.txt](https://spec.torproject.org/dir-spec).
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! NOTE: The consensus format has changes time, using a
//! "consensus-method" mechanism.  This module is does not yet handle all
//! all historical consensus-methods.
//!
//! NOTE: This module _does_ parse some fields that are not in current
//! use, like relay nicknames, and the "published" times on
//! microdescriptors. We should probably decide whether we actually
//! want to do this.
//!
//! TODO: This module doesn't implement vote parsing at all yet.
//!
//! TODO: This module doesn't implement ns-flavored consensuses.
//!
//! TODO: More testing is needed!
//!
//! TODO: There should be accessor functions for most of the fields here.
//! As with the other tor-netdoc types, I'm deferring those till I know what
//! they should be.
