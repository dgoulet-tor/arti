# retry-error

An error attempt to represent multiple failures.

This crate implements [`RetryError`], a type to use when you
retry something a few times, and all those attempts.  Instead of
returning only a single error, it records _all of the errors
received_, in case they are different.

This crate is developed as part of
[Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
It's used by higher-level crates that retry
operations.

## Example

```rust
use retry_error::RetryError;

const N_ATTEMPTS: usize = 10;
let mut err = RetryError::in_attempt_to("perform an example operation");
for _ in 0..N_ATTEMPTS {
    match some_operation() {
        Ok(val) => return Ok(val),
        Err(e) => err.push(e),
    }
}
// All attempts failed; return all the errors.
return Err(err)
```
