//! Implements SOCKS in the flavors provided by Tor.
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! SOCKS is an old and somewhat janky protocol for telling a TCP
//! proxy where to connect.  Versions 4, 4a, and 5 are sometimes
//! encountered in the wild.
//!
//! The `tor-socksproto` crate tries to hide the actual details of the
//! protocol, and expose a stateful handshake type that eventually
//! provides a [`SocksRequest`] or an error.  It is part of
//! [Arti](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti/), a project to
//! implement [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) in Rust.
//! At present, it is only used to provide a
//! SOCKS proxy _over_ the Tor network, but eventually it may be used
//! to implement support for connecting to the Tor network over a
//! SOCKS proxy.
//!
//! This crate may be a good choice for you if you need a SOCKS
//! implementation that "behaves like Tor", but otherwise it is
//! probably better to use some other SOCKS crate.
//!
//! For more information about SOCKS:
//!
//!   * SOCKS5 (which is preferred) is specified in
//!     [RFC 1928](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1928), and see also
//!     [RFC 1929](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1929) for
//!     Username/Password authentication in SOCKS5.
//!   * [The wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS)
//!     is the best surviving documentation for SOCKS4 and SOCKS4a.
//!   * See
//!     [socks-extensions.txt](https://spec.torproject.org/socks-extensions)
//!     for a description of Tor's extensions and restrictions on the
//!     SOCKS protocol.
//!
//! ## Design notes
//!
//! Arti uses this crate instead of some other SOCKS implementation,
//! for two reasons:
//!
//!  * First, because we need to support Tor SOCKS extensions.
//!  * Second, and because we sometimes need to see particular details
//!    of the individual handshakes that most other SOCKS
//!    implementations don't expose.  (For example, if we are told to
//!    connect to a raw IP address, the type of the handshake can help
//!    us guess whether that IP address came from a DNS response–in
//!    which case we should warn about a possible DNS leak.)
//!
//! Currently, `tor-socksproto` does no networking code: it _only_
//! implements the server (proxy) side of the SOCKS handshake by
//! handling a series of bytes.  We may (or may not) want to add
//! network functionality to this crate or elsewhere in the future.
//! We'll definitely want to add client functionality.
//!
//! Possibly, this approach will prove useful for other uses.  If it
//! does, We can put the tor-only functionality behind a Cargo build
//! feature, so that others can use this crate more safely.
