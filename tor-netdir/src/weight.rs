//! Functions for applying the correct weights to relays when choosing
//! a relay at random.
//!
//! The weight to use when picking a relay depends on several factors:
//!
//! - The relay's *apparent bandwidth*.  (This is ideally measured by a set of
//!   bandwidth authorities, but if no bandwidth authorities are running (as on
//!   a test network), we might fall back either to relays' self-declared
//!   values, or we might treat all relays as having equal bandwidth.)
//! - The role that we're selecting a relay to play.  (See [`WeightRole`]).
//! - The flags that a relay has in the consensus, and their scarcity.  If a
//!   relay provides particularly scarce functionality, we might choose not to
//!   use it for other roles, or to use it less commonly for them.
