/// An implementation for retrying downloads based on a decorrelated jitter
/// schedule.
///
/// The algorithm used here has several desirable properties:
///    * It is randomized, so that multiple timeouts don't have a
///      danger of getting synchronized with each other and hammering the
///      same directory servers all at once.
///    * It tends on average to wait longer and longer over time, so
///      that if the directory server is down, it won't get pummeled by
///      a zillion failing clients when it comes back up.
///    * It has a chance of retrying promptly, which results in better
///      client performance on average.
